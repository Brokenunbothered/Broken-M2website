<p> About me:Hello I am Broken! I am the creator of the show Paying Paper, If you wondering what Paying Paper is it is a show about a stick-figure named Till. He goes on WaCkY adventures. The idea for the show was boiling in my mind since March of 2021! The show is animated in a little program known as Flash 8. Bye.<p/>

<p id="demo">Hello I like cartoons.</p>
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Oh yeah and uhh games? I really don't know at this point";
</script>
}
</iframe>
This is just the START of what I do.
<p> So I also make games? They aren't really anything good, just simple flash.</p>
<p> I would show some but ya know flash is no longer supported. </p>
<p> Think this website is done... it told you what I do, think its time for me to go and you to! Bye!
